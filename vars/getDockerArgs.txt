The function makes sure 'docker run' gets the kvm group gid

In some configurations, when running in docker, debos will fail because
it can't load kvm producing errors like:
    Could not access KVM kernel module: Permission denied
    failed to initialize KVM: Permission denied
    open /tmp/fakemachine-582582565/result: no such file or directory

This can be prevented passing the kvm group gid to docker with --group-add
